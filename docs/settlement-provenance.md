# Settlement provenance isolation

`settled_route_observation=0` is not enough. Tentative route observations
must not move trusted product state.

## Trust classes

| Class | How it is written | Trusted? |
|---|---|---|
| `INDEPENDENT` | `record_probe` default (validate/health/manual) | yes |
| `SCHEDULED` | `record_probe` with `scheduled=true` or `trust_class=SCHEDULED` | yes |
| `ROUTE_TENTATIVE` | `persist_route_batch` before settlement | no (diagnostics only) |
| `ROUTE_SETTLED` | `mark_batch_settled` after a successful pay | yes (may promote) |

Trusted classes may update `url_state`, `last_checked`, `last_trusted_ts`,
`last_success_402`, payTo pending/change, price/schema change clocks,
`summary`, `rank_hints`, `preview` / history joins, reputation evidence,
pulse rates, and shadow `last_verified` / `last_routed`.

`ROUTE_TENTATIVE` rows are stored for diagnostics and attestation of that
route batch. They do not write `url_state` and do not touch shadow
freshness.

## Traffic class

Hosted `/route` persists `traffic_class` as `organic`, `sponsored`,
`internal`, or `unclassified`. Lab origins stay `self_test`. The caller
cannot select the class. Unknown defaults to `unclassified`, never
`organic`.

Public `last_success_402`, public `n_7d`, rank weights, and the scoring
sample use **organic** rows only. Sponsored, internal, unclassified, and
self-test rows are retained and do not move those public clocks. Public
`last_success_402` is `MAX(ts)` of live trusted organic probes, not the
stored url_state clock. Pre-class rows stay unclassified; they are not
backfilled to organic.

Unpaid `/validate` still does not write `402signal_observed`. It may
update `url_state.last_checked` and stamp flip timestamps
(`payTo_changed_at`, `price_changed_at`, `schema_changed_at`) from a
read-only compare. It does not write `last_payTo`, `pending_payTo`,
`last_amount`, `schema_present`, or `last_success_402`, and it does not
set `last_trusted_ts`. Late settlement skip uses `last_trusted_ts`, not
seller `last_checked`.

A success-only free miss returns before `mark_batch_settled`. It remains
tentative, does not affect observed success or reputation as settled route
evidence, and does not enter the PQ route-decision append path.

## Old rows

Additive column `trust_class` on `probes` and `observations`.

- old `settled_route_observation=0` -> `ROUTE_TENTATIVE`
- old `settled_route_observation=1` -> `INDEPENDENT` (trusted)

We do not rewrite historical `url_state` from before this change.

## Pre-settlement payTo risk

Read-only: compare the tentative observation to trusted `url_state`.
The current `/route` result may flag `payTo_pending` / `payTo_changed`
so selection and `accept_payTo_change` still work. Failed settlement
does not persist those flags.

## PayTo rotation (trusted observations only)

1. Trusted A is `last_payTo`.
2. Two failed tentative B observations after A do not establish B and
   do not write `pending_payTo`.
3. Settled B after trusted A sets `pending_payTo=B` (`last_payTo` stays A).
4. A later independent trusted B, or a later settled B, may establish B.
5. `accept_payTo_change` still opts into selecting a first-change dest
   on the current request.

## mark_batch_settled

One sqlite transaction:

1. Mark matching tentative probes/observations `ROUTE_SETTLED`.
2. Recompute each URL's trusted `url_state`.
3. Commit, then update shadow freshness for URLs that were actually
   applied.

Late settlement of an older observation does not overwrite a newer
trusted `last_trusted_ts` / payTo / price / schema row. Seller
`last_checked` from unpaid `/validate` is not that guard.
